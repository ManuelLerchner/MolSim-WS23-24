# Presentation Branch

## Presentation

This branch contains the presentations for the project. Every weeek has a folder with all the required files.

## How to use

Each week should contain a `README.md` with the layout given by the `templates/SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md` file, as well as a `GroupC_AssignmentX.pdf` file with the presentation slides. Additional videos or other files can be added as well. The presentation slides can be adapted from the `templates/PRESENTATION_TEMPLATE.pptx` file.

### Example Folder Structure

+ `sheetXX`
  + `data`
    + (All files created to solve this week's sheet go here, e.g. `images`, `paraview.pvsm`, etc.)
  + `submission`
    + `README.md`
    + `GroupC_AssignmentX.pdf`
    + `video.avi`
    + `screenshot.png`

**WARNING**: Don't merge this branch with the master branch. This branch is *only* for the presentations and doesn't contain any code.
