# Presentation Branch

[![Check Submission Format](https://github.com/ManuelLerchner/MolSim-WS23-24/actions/workflows/submission-format.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ManuelLerchner/MolSim-WS23-24/actions/workflows/submission-format.yml)

## Presentation

This branch contains the presentations for the project. Every week has a folder with all the required files.

## How to use

Each weeks submission should contain a `README.md` with the layout given by the `templates/SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md` file, as well as a `GroupC_AssignmentXX.pdf` file with the presentation slides. Additional videos or other files can be added as well. The presentation slides can be adapted from the `templates/PRESENTATION_TEMPLATE.pptx` file.

### Example Folder Structure

+ `sheetXX`
  + `data`
    + (All files created to solve this week's sheet go here, e.g. `images`, `paraview.pvsm`, etc.)
  + `submission`
    + `README.md`
    + `GroupC_AssignmentX.pdf`
    + `video.mp4`
    + `screenshot.png`
