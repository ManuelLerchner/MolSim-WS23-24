# Presentation Branch

## Presentation

This branch contains the presentations for the project. Every weeek has a folder with all the required files.

## How to use

Each week should contain a `README.md` with the layout given by the `SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md` file, as well as a `GroupC_AssignmentX.pdf` file with the presentation slides. Additional videos or other files can be added as well.

### Example Folder Structure

+ `week01`
  + `README.md`
  + `GroupC_Assignment1.pdf`
  + `halleys_comet.avi`
  + `earth_sun.png`

**WARNING**: Don't merge this branch with the master branch. This branch is *only* for the presentations and doesn't contain any code.
