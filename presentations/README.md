# Presentation Folder

## Presentation

This folder contains the presentations for the project. Every week has a folder with all the required files.

## How to use

Each week should contain a `README.md` with the layout given by the `templates/SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md` file, as well as a `GroupC_AssignmentX.pdf` file with the presentation slides. Additional videos or other files can be added as well. The presentation slides can be adapted from the `templates/PRESENTATION_TEMPLATE.pptx` file.

### Example Folder Structure
