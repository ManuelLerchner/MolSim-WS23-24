# Sheet 1: Team C

Members of **Team C**:

* Manuel Lerchner

## Code

* Link:     <https://github.com/ManuelLerchner/MolSim-WS23-24>
* Branch:   master
* Revision: <TODO>
* Compiler: gcc 13.1.0 (But should work most up to date compilers)

## Report

### Task 1: "First steps"

* There is not much to say about this task. We downloaded `doxygen` and `paraview` and cloned the repository. Everything worked fine, as we were all able to seemlessly install the required software and to compile the code.

### Task 2: "Completion of the program frame"

1. **Graviational force calculation**
   * Implementing the force calculations between the planets was quite easy, because we could just copy the formula from the slides. However we still managed to mess up the formula and ended up with repelling planets instead. This was a funny looking bug, but it was furtunately easy to fix. Afterwards the simulation looked as expected.
2. **Creating VTK Output Files**
   * This fix was also quite easy, as we just had to change a single function to use another `OutputWriter` class, which was already implemented. This worked without any problems.
3. **Creating Binary Output Files**
   * <TODO>

### Task 3: "Simulation of Halleys comet"

* Simulating the system worked flawelessly and the movement of the planets looked as expected. A video of the simulation, can be found in the `submisssion` folder. The video is called `halleys_comet.mp4`.
* We also played around with `paraview` and tried to create some nice looking visualizations. We ended up coloring each body according to its look in the real world. The sun is yellow, the earth is green, jupiter is orange and halleys comet is brown. To put a scale reference into the video, we also added spheres with the average orbit radius for the planets. The earth orbits per definition at 1 AU (in average). Jupiter at 5.2 AU.
* We found it quite cool, that we could actually see the slight elliptical orbits of all the planets which is caused by real world physics (And maybe a bit by the numerical integration method ^^).
* Halleys comet comes close to the sun and then flies out again. Just as expected, as it is in a highly elliptical orbit.

### Task 4: "Refactoring and documentation"

<TODO>

### Misc

* We already played around a bit with the github actions and created some basic workflows to build the code and automatically deploy the documentation. This worked quite well. The actions can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/ManuelLerchner/MolSim-WS23-24/tree/master/.github/workflows). The doxygen documentation is automatically built and deployed to github pages hosted at [https://manuellerchner.github.io/MolSim-WS23-24/](https://manuellerchner.github.io/MolSim-WS23-24/).
* We also looked into the github project management features and created a [project board](https://github.com/users/ManuelLerchner/projects/4) to keep track of the tasks. This board is automated and automatically updates itself when we create new issues or pull requests, begin work on features or finish issues. We also created a [milestone](https://github.com/ManuelLerchner/MolSim-WS23-24/milestone/1) for the first sheet and assigned all issues to this milestone. This way we can kept track of the progress of the sheet and could easily see how much work is left to do.
